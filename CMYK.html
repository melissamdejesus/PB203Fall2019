		<h2 class="glossaryterm">CMYK</h2>
		<p>stands for "Cyan Magenta Yellow Black,” the four basic colors used for printing color images. Unlike RGB (red, green, blue), which is used for creating images on your computer screen, CMYK colors are "subtractive." This means the colors get darker as you blend them together. Since RGB colors are used for light, not pigments, the colors grow brighter as you blend them or increase their intensity. Computer screens display colors using RGB color values. Printers often presents colors using CMYK color values
