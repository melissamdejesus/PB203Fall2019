		<h2 class="glossaryterm">HTML5</h2>
		<p>HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a large set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set is sometimes called HTML5 and friends and often shortened to just HTML5.
