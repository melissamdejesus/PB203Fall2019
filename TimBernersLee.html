		<p>Tim Berners-Lee is one of the starters of networks, along with Robert Cailliau. His lecture which we viewed titled <i>Hypertext and Our Collective Destiny</i> described a "sea of interactive shared knowledge." He spoke about how a link had grown to imply readership. One of his more interesting points in my opinion was that the web did not end up being the abject space it was intended to be, instead becoming influenced by and influencing society.
