		<h2>Fixed-Layout</h2>
		<p>Glossary Definition: A fixed-layout ebook defines a viewport, i.e. the size of the “page” in pixels, and usually contains many images exactly positioned relative to text. Some good examples of fixed-layout publications are photo books, magazines and comics. An electronic “page” is the strict rendition of a printed page : on a small screen, you’ll usually have to zoom and scroll in the page (often vertically AND horizontally) to read the text.<cite>Definition adapted from <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/epub/reflowable-vs-fixed-layout/">Source citation, linked if online.</a> by <span class="contributor">Alannys Milano</span>
