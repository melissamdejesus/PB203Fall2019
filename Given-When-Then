		<h2 class="glossaryterm">Given-When-Then</h2>
		<p>a structured format for expressing scenarios with example data, including pre- and post-conditions. It's an approach developed by Daniel Terhorst-North and Chris Matts as part of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).

The essential idea can be broken down like so:
(Given) some context
(When) some action is carried out
(Then) a particular set of observable consequences should obtain

An example:
Given my bank account is in credit, and I made no withdrawals recently,
When I attempt to withdraw an amount less than my card’s limit,
Then the withdrawal should complete without errors or warnings

The given part describes the state of the world before you begin the behavior you're specifying in this scenario. You can think of it as the pre-conditions to the test.
The when section is that behavior that you're specifying.
Finally the then section describes the changes you expect due to the specified behavior.
