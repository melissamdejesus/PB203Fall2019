        <p class="sansserif"; style= "background-color:#e6ffff">For all of you who are not aware of what a sitemap is, I am here to help you with that.        
        A sitemap according to siteground.com, is a file where you provide information about how the pages, videos, images, and other files on your site, and the relationships between them. In other words, it provides the search engine with detailed information about the content of your website. </p>
        
        <h2 style= "text-align: center"> How does a sitemap look like? <h2>
            
    <img src="sitemap.jpeg.jpg" alt="Sitemap as in Html" width="800" height="500" class="center">
            
        <h3 style= "background-color:#e6ffff "; class="sansserif" >            
        <p class="sansserif"; style= "text-align: center";> Here I will revise the lines of the sitemap line by line  
            
        <ul > 
            
         
        <li class="sanssserif">Every sitemap XML file must begin with an opening tag "urlset" and must end with "/urlset" </li>
        <li class="sanssserif"> Every "parent" entry should begin with "url" tag and end with "/url". </li>
        <li class="sanssserif"> In a similar way every "child" entry should be placed between "loc" and "/loc" tags. </li>
        <li class="sanssserif"> After a "loc" tag, an URL is expected which should start with http://. The lenght of the URL can be 2048 characters at most. </li>
        <li class="sanssserif"> The "lastmod" tag expects a date in the following format YYYY-MM-DD. </li>
        <li class="sanssserif"> The "changefreq" tag is used as a hint for the crawlers to indicate how often the page is modified and how often it should be indexed. The "changefreq" tag expects one of the following values: alaways, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, never. Be advised that always is used for pages which are dynamically generated or changed/modified upon access.</li>
        <li class="sanssserif"> The "priority" value can vary from 0.0 to 1. Be advised that this indicate only your personal preferences for the way you would like to have your website indexed.</li>
        </ul>
