		<h2 class="glossaryterm">Accessible Color Contrast</h2>
        <p> Accessible Color Contrast refers to the contrast between the background color of a site and the color of the text. There are two ratings to determine whether your site's color contrast is accessible: AA, or AAA. AA is the minimum requirement for contrast accessiblity, while AAA is the preferred requirement for contrast accessibility. There are a lot of sites to test whether your site has accessible color contrast. Accessible Color Contrast makes your site easy to read, not just for "standard" users but also for visually impaired or color-blind users.  </p>
