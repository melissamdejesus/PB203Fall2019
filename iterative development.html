		<h2 class="glossaryterm">Iterative Development</h2>
        <p> A process of developing something, especially games or software, by creating a minimum viable product "build" and testing it, checking for problems, and then fixing problems and moving on to the next build. This process is repeated until the project has reached the desired complexity.</p>
