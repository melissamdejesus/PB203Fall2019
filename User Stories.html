		<h2>User Stories</h2>
		<p>In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. A user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

User stories are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or in project management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders such as clients, users, managers or development team members. <a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story/#:~:targetText=A%20user%20story%20is%20a,simplified%20description%20of%20a%20requirement.">Source citation, linked if online.</a> by <span class="Visual Paradigms">Alannys Milano</span>
